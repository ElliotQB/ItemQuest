<h1>ItemQuest</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
This is my final project I made for a game development class. It's a short metroid-vania style prototype which sees the player, a stick figure, collecting various items, some of which grant them new movement abilities.

<h2>Installation Guide</h2>
Download <a href="https://www.raylib.com/">Raylib</a> and <a href="https://go.dev/doc/install">Go</a> and, with the directory open in a terminal window, run <code>go run</code>.
